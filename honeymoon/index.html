<p></p><p>Hello from Hong Kong International Airport!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are awaiting our flight to New York’s JFK airport and we are excited to be coming home. &nbsp;You really start to miss the United States after a while, including people who tell you to “Have a good one!” and correctly call it an “elevator” and not a “lift”, who let you order food “to go” and not “to takeaway”, and who stand “in line” and not “queue”.</p>
<p>The two trips have been wonderful, eye-opening, tons of fun and better than either of us could have expected. We also learned that we could spend 24 hours a day together for extended periods of time without any turbulence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will sign off for now but will be posting from the U.S. soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 8,000 miles away, the Greatest City in the World is calling -</p>

<h2>Last Day of the Honeymoon Extravaganza<br>

</h2>
<p></p><p>Today was the last day of our Honeymoon Extravaganza and the city with the honor of hosting this momentous event is Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We started out today looking for good dim sum. &nbsp;Matt is still haunted by the stellar dim sum we had at Fook Lam Moon, but I somehow convinced him to try another place in Hong Kong. &nbsp;We started first at the famous Yung Kee, but they don’t start serving dim sum until 2&nbsp;pm. &nbsp;Then we ambled over to the Lin Heung Tea House but I was too intimidated by the process (1. You walk in and no one acknowledges your presence, 2. You stake out a seat, likely at a shared table. &nbsp;It’s crowded so you will have to stand behind people who look like they’re about done, 3. You try desperately to flag down staff for tea, food, attention.) &nbsp;Then we headed over to Michelin-starred Cuisine Cuisine in the IFC Mall, but the banking buffoons had booked it solid.</p>
<p>Defeated we headed out to Sham Shui Po, where we were planning to shop anyway. &nbsp;Sham Shui Po is way off the tourist track, a working-class neighborhood where locals do their shopping. &nbsp;There, we ended up eating at Tim Ho Wan, which is, it turns out, one of the best places to have dim sum in Hong Kong and the cheapest restaurant in the world with a Michelin star. &nbsp;We had 8 plates of dim sum and tea for about $15 USD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After some light shopping in Sham Shui Po, I went to take a nap and Matt went for a walk to the Hollywood Road and Cat Street antiques markets, followed by the HK Botanical and Zoological Garden. &nbsp;He also took his 50th ride on the Mid-Levels Escalator. &nbsp;I told him that he should jut marry the Mid-Levels Escalator and he said maybe he would.</p>
<p>We finished off the day with a lovely dinner in Causeway Bay and an extended tram ride through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We have had a wonderful time, but we are looking forward to coming home.</p>
<p>Stay tuned - Honeymoon statistics and awards are coming soon!</p>

<h2>Relaxing on Sentosa Island<br>
<font size="2"> [ Posted <a href="http://mattandwilla.tumblr.com/post/17604711910"> Tue, 14 Feb 2012 07:43:52</a> ]</font>
</h2>
<p></p><p>On the advice of our cab driver from last night’s trip to the Night Safari, we ventured off Singapore island to Sentosa Island today. &nbsp;It’s an island right off the coast (so close there’s a pedestrian bridge) that Singapore has turned into a resort and entertainment island - complete with a casino, Universal Studios, water and sports parks and shows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing we were interested in was Tanjong Beach, one of their man-made beaches. It’s the island’s most secluded and tranquil beach so it attracts mostly couples (Happy Valentine’s Day everybody!). &nbsp;It was fairly quiet and we were able to snag a wooden umbrella. &nbsp;We swam and read our Kindles and relaxed. &nbsp;Who cares if it’s artificial? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Matt persuaded me to walk from Tanjong Beach to Palawan Beach nearby, something that Sentosa obviously doesn’t encourage you do to do. &nbsp;We made it through heavy brush and then we were attacked by a Tyrannosaurus-Rex. &nbsp;It sprang out from under a bunker wearing camouflage and a helmet with branches and leaves glued to it. &nbsp;Luckily, I was able to scare it away by looking big. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt insists that you ask for his version of these events.</p>

<h2>Little India, Mustafa Center, Bugis, and the Night Safari<br>

</h2>
<p></p><p>We started off the day in our usual way, by walking across the street from our hotel to the Maxwell Street Hawker Center and picking up fruit drinks for breakfast. &nbsp;You choose what ever you’d like from the huge array of beautiful fresh fruit (watermelon, papaya, mango, dragonfruit, guava, jack fruit, to name a few) and they toss it in a blender. &nbsp;Our favorite so far is watermelon and mint. &nbsp;Then we caught the subway out to Little India.</p>
<p>Little India was neat, and very colorful. &nbsp;Among other things, we checked out the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple — Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple — and the Mustafa Center, which is an incredibly large department store/supermarket for Singapore’s Indian populace.</p>
<p>It’s a short walk from Little India to Bugis and Haji Lane, center of Singapore’s Arab population. &nbsp;After exploring this area for a bit, we caught the MRT (subway) at Bugis Station (Bugis!) back to our hotel to nap through the heat of the day. &nbsp;We grabbed dinner at the hawker center across the street, and then headed out for the Night Safari!</p>
<p>The Night Safari is run by the Singapore Zoo and it is a lot of fun. &nbsp;It starts with a tram ride through the Southeast Asian jungle — headlights off, completely dark — and periodically you come to clearings in the jungle where you may see an animal like a rhino, lion, or elephant, or one of the funky Malaysian or Indonesian deer. &nbsp;After the tram ride, you are free to explore, and there are pathways that criss-cross the safari area, giving access to many more animals, like leopards, tapirs, and, our favorite, the slow loris.</p>
<p>One of the coolest things was just like an aviary except instead of birds it was fruit bats. &nbsp;It’s very dark, you are on an elevated walkway through a jungle, there are a few soft lights aimed at the pathway to keep you from falling off, and through the air all around you are BIG bats. &nbsp;They come very close and you can feel the air from their wings. &nbsp;Willa was not happy and we did not stay long.</p>

<p></p><p>Since it often feels like 95 degrees (and Matt is apparently made of wax), we started our day in the heavily air-conditioned National Museum of Singapore. &nbsp;This very well done, and very rich, museum has a large history gallery that presents the history of Singapore and a few “living” galleries that have interactive displays on food and art in the city. &nbsp;We learned that the city has always been as diverse as it is now and that benevolent dictator Lee Kwan Yew basically made this island a world power out of sheer will.</p>
<p>We then followed our stomachs to the air-conditioned food courts on Orchard Road where we had a quick lunch before repairing to our air-conditioned hotel room for NAPS.</p>
<p>In the evening, we took a walk through Chinatown and along the river entertainment districts of Collier Quay, Marina Bay and Clarke Quay. &nbsp;The city is beautiful at night.</p>

<h2>Relief in Singapore<br>

<p></p><p>Sorry we have been out of range for the last few days - we’ve been traveling and have been away from the internet. &nbsp;To make up for it, we have four separate posts today! &nbsp;One for Singapore, one for Kyoto, one of travel and a special bonus edition on bathrooms in Japan. &nbsp;First one up is Singapore:</p>
<p>As beautiful and exciting as Japan was, it felt very foreign. &nbsp;The food was different, we never spoke to anyone who was fully fluent in our native tongue and had to work hard to figure out how to get around.</p>
<p>Singapore is a relief. &nbsp;The stores (and the products in them) are very similar to the U.S., it’s simple to get around, everyone speaks English and the food! &nbsp;Japan seemed to have something against fruits and vegetables, which is bad news for our systems, if you know what I mean… &nbsp;Singapore is a big fan of fruit, in drink form, in salad form, in any form you can think of. &nbsp;Vegetables are also plentiful and cheap. &nbsp;It has been a relief, in more ways than one.</p>
<p>We toured the Orchard Road shopping malls and had dinner at a Chinatown Hawker Center - a collection of food stalls that have been forced indoors due to government health regulations. &nbsp;Tasty and cheap. &nbsp;We also napped through the heat of the day in our air conditioned hotel room. &nbsp;It was 89 degrees today. &nbsp;It was 34 degrees and snowing two days ago in Kyoto! &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Japan Special Bonus Bathroom Edition<br>
<font size="2"> [ Posted <a href="http://mattandwilla.tumblr.com/post/17417259326"> Sat, 11 Feb 2012 03:30:25</a> ]</font>

<p></p><p>For those who are curious, we have been keeping track of bathroom facilities in Japan. &nbsp;If you are sensitive or squeamish, please skip this post entirely as we’ll be using words like “flush”, “spray” and “pooper”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Japan might be the most advanced civilization in the world when it comes to bathrooms based on the following guidelines:</p>
<p>1. Bathrooms should be everywhere - on street corners, in parks , in transit stations, on every floor of a department store and every restaurant.</p>
<p>2. Bathrooms should be clean - there’s no tell-tale stink of human excretions in any of these facilities. &nbsp;Yes, some of them you even have to change shoes to go into.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lz7zd4OV0Q1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Shoes at a bathroom in one of the temples.</em></p>
<p>3. No one wants to hear you do your business - as such, there are “Flush Noise” buttons that play the sound of a flushing toilet for the duration of your stay. &nbsp;And your business.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lz7zesAOUY1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Flush noise speakers.</em></p>
<p>4. No one likes a cold toilet seat - heated toilet seats. &nbsp;Until you have experienced it, there is no way to describe the luxury of a perpetually heated toilet seat.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lz7zgtm5j11r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p><em>This toilet seat is heated - you’ll have to take our word for it.</em></p>
<p>5. Wiping is no way to get clean - instead, the bathrooms have both “Spray” and “Bidet” functions that shoot pleasantly warm water either straight into your pooper (“Spray”) or along the entire region in question (“Bidet”).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lz7zilf3Tx1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p><em>The control panel, including options to increase/decrease water pressure and temperature on your pooper.</em></p>
<p>6. No one wants to smell you do your business - deodorizers come in the form of poring water to cover your poop or pee, or a light mist of perfume.</p>
<p>All in all - the only thing that we would look into getting is the heated toilet seat because it’s spoiled all other toilet seats out there.</p><p></p>

<p></p><p>On our last full day in Kyoto, we spent most of our day in Southern Higashimya, which is about a half hour walk from our hotel. &nbsp;The weather forecast was for sunshine, but we were delighted when it started to snow. &nbsp;Kyoto’s temples and shrines take on different moods in different weather, so we’ve gotten to see them in the rain, sunshine and now snow. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We started our day at the Disney equivalent of a temple - the Kiyomizudera, it was interactive with drums and bells and sacred wells to drink from. &nbsp;There was also a little side temple that was meant to symbolize the womb of the female bodhisattva. &nbsp;For 100 yen, you take off your shoes and descend into a completely dark basement, where you use a beaded handrail to guide you to a stone that you can spin to make wishes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After our temple visit, we walked around Gion, a neighborhood where many of the streets have retained the Old Kyoto feel. &nbsp;We had lunch in a tea house which had floor seating but opted for chair seating (this was not an option at dinner and we sat on the floor and enjoyed it). &nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>Today, we decided to stay close to our hotel, which happens to be in Northern Higashimaya - home to the Tetsugaku no Michi (“Path of Philosophy”) and numerous beautiful gardens, shrines and temples. &nbsp;Our impression of Kyoto is that you can stop anywhere you want, whether it is a temple, a garden, a shrine or a passageway, and be awed by the scenery around you. &nbsp;It’s a wonder that they got anything done here back when it was Japan’s capitol, as you could just stop and stare and ponder forever.</p>
<p>Along the Path of Philosophy, we ran into an old Aqueduct, many Zen gardens with raked gravel designs, huge temple gates and beautiful temples set against the misty Higashimaya mountains. &nbsp;Along the way, we wandered into one of the most beautiful places we’ve ever been - the Oku-no-in.</p>
<p>We then crossed back into urban Kyoto (it’s a nice little city, but that’s not what you come to Kyoto for) and walked down the Ponto-Cho, an alleyway that is crowded on both sides with ancient little restaurants. &nbsp;The alley is atmospheric with old two-story Japanese buildings and lanterns hanging out front. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Did we mention how beautiful it is here? &nbsp;Just thought we put that out there.</p>

<h2>Tokyo to Kyoto on the Shinkansen<br>

<p></p><p>Today, we took another trip on the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto. &nbsp;If you’ll recall, we originally planned to go to Osaka. &nbsp;However, we changed our minds after reading that Kyoto was one of the most beautiful cities in the world and that Osaka is to Tokyo as Boston is to New York - that is to say crippling Super Bowl losers. &nbsp;Again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The game was going on while we were on the Shinkansen, but we used the 3G wireless internet on Willa’s Kindle to keep updated on the score. &nbsp;We lived through the exciting last few minutes when the Giants won it, but we were afraid to cheer because the train full of Japanese businessmen was whisper quiet. &nbsp;Like so quiet that MATT could fall asleep.</p>
<p>Not many photos today since this was a travel day. &nbsp;We did take advantage of our new hotel’s pool, sauna and jacuzzi facilities. &nbsp;To the temples and shrines tomorrow!</p><p></p>

<p></p><p>Today, we rode the Shinkansen. That is all that needs to be said.</p>
<p>While we waited for our Shinkansen to Nikko, we ran around taking photos and videos of the world’s fastest train. The Japan Railways staff bemusedly reminded us to stay behind the yellow lines so we wouldn’t get hit by a train traveling 300&nbsp;km/h. The Shinkansen is so badass that the JR staff on the platform bow to it as it explodes into the station. &nbsp;Seriously.</p>
<p>You sure are going fast on the train, too. The other Shinkansen passengers are extremely quiet, but that could just be the way of the ultra-polite Japanese (except for one passenger who was drinking liquor straight from a bottle). Also, heated toilet seats on the train!</p>
<p>We transferred to the Nikko Local line, a very cute train that runs to Nikko, Japan. Nikko is home to the shrines of the Tokugawa Shoguns and is beautiful - gorgeous red, gold and green temples set against the foothills of a snow covered mountain range. We visited three major temples and meandered along stone pathways with lichen-covered stone monuments and lanterns.</p>
<p>Following this, we hiked into the gorge called the Kanmangafuchi Abyss and it was even more beautiful than the shrines. Unlike the temple area, we more or less had the Abyss to ourselves and saw a stream with powder blue water thundering down rocks, and long lines of lichen-covered stone buddhas. Forgive us if we wax poetic - it was a setting that had us looking at each other and saying, “Wow. This is so cool.”</p>
<p>We also did as the Romans (Japanese) do and bought little box lunches to eat on the Shinkansen. More Shinkansen tomorrow as we head to Kyoto!</p>

<p></p><p>We’ve been noticing that Tokyo is a city of contrasts, with tranquil gardens and shrines along with skyscrapers and shopping areas that give you seizures. &nbsp;This was especially apparent today as we started our day in Kagurazaka, which has a bustling neighborhood retail street with interesting stores, restaurants and bakeries, and back alleys with shrines and people’s laundry hanging out. &nbsp;We got our lunch at a nearby supermarket and wolfed it down in the playground, ignoring the horrified expressions of children as we ate with gusto.</p>
<p>Then we headed to the Tsukiji Fish Market of the famous pre-dawn tuna auction. &nbsp;Although we got there too late for the auction, we got there at the perfect time for the goods of the market to be on display in the “External Market”. &nbsp;There were beautiful pieces of tuna, salmon, oysters, as well as live octopus, live crabs and stuffed polar bears, mountain lions, leopards and one very stuffed American bald eagle. &nbsp;We kid you not.</p>
<p>From Tsukiji, we headed to downtown Tokyo, where the skyscrapers live right next to the Imperial Palace and Garden. &nbsp;The Palace was the base of the Tokunagawa Shogunate during their reign. &nbsp;Though most of the buildings have burned down, some foundations and a lovely garden still exists. &nbsp;Men in Japanese robes still stroll the gardens here, at their own risk, as photo-stalkers like Matt follow them at discreet distance.</p>
<p>From downton Tokyo, we visited Akusaka an ancient area of street markets centered around a big, popular shrine. &nbsp; It was a very hopping area and hopefully an appetizer for the shrines we will see tomorrow in Nikko.</p>

<p></p><p>We started the day back in Shinjuku. &nbsp;It’s one of the few places in the city where you can pick up your JapanRail pass (which is a good deal and only available to visitors, sort of like the Eurail pass). &nbsp;After picking up our rail passes, we had udon for lunch. &nbsp;It was even better than yesterday’s ramen. Again, the drill was: no talking, slurp hard and as fast as possible.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lytiagDxSU1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<div></div>
<p>We then caught a subway across town to the Fukugawa Edo Museum — thanks to Tian for the recommendation! &nbsp;It is a big warehouse inside of which they have reconstructed an Edo-era village, complete with houses, grocers, and sawmill.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lyti0oPiRD1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p>You can walk right into many of the houses and open the cupboards and poke around. &nbsp;You can even awkwardly fold your body (still full of udon) into a sitting position at one of the model dinner tables.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lytibkOIwl1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p>Up the street from the Edo museum we saw a sign for a garden. &nbsp;So we went in and found an incredible serene place. &nbsp;Put together during the Edo period and then purchased by Iwasaki Yataro, the founder of Mitsubishi, the garden is now open to the public. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lyti77PxG91r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<div></div>
<div>It’s a beautiful pathway around a small lake full of ducks and carp. &nbsp;The pathway is lined with boulders that were selected and shipped from all over Japan by Yataro’s wife. &nbsp;She had good taste — the boulders are really neat looking.</div>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lytigrsW9T1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p>We left the gardens and headed across town to what may be as different a place as you can get in Japan — Akihabara Electric Town. &nbsp;The center of the world for electric gadgets, knick-knacks and doodads.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lytii3gB9J1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p>For dinner, our hotel recommended to us a sushi bar in the Suidobashi neighborhood. &nbsp;It was the best sushi Matt has ever had. &nbsp;Willa doesn’t really appreciate sushi, but she thought it was pretty good. &nbsp;The tuna was soft and marbled and buttery. &nbsp;The uni was delicate and spectacular. &nbsp;We were the only people at the bar, except for two salarymen eating quietly in the corner, so we had a great time trying to communicate with the chef. &nbsp;He was very excited about his sushi and, though we could not speak each other’s languages, it was fun learning from him the various things we were eating. &nbsp;He enjoyed showing us how fresh his food was and, at one point, uncovered an abalone that was still beating! &nbsp;Gross! &nbsp;Awesome!</p>
<p>We ended the day in Roppongi, Tokyo’s nightlife district. &nbsp;It was full of bars and high end restaurants. &nbsp;We wanted to see what the kids do at night here and the answer is eat, drink and sometimes sing karaoke. &nbsp;Seems about right. &nbsp;There was an excellent store there called Don Quixote where they sold assorted craziness.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lytjubhqJH1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p>The best thing on sale was Joke Pocky. &nbsp;It looks just like a regular box of Pocky, but when you offer it to someone and they try to pull out a stick of Pocky … they get a face full of Pocky! &nbsp;Oh, snap! &nbsp;You been served. &nbsp;By Pocky.</p><p></p>

<h2>First day in Tokyo: Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku<br>

<p></p><p>Hello, Tokyo! &nbsp;You wacky son-of-a-shogun. &nbsp;Today we started out our day in Shibuya, home of the famous eight-way (it could be less) all-way pedestrian crosswalk that is often seen in film, and a ramen place that Matt read about.</p>
<p>Since there are no street names in Tokyo, it took us a while, and several wrong turns, to find this nondescript ramen bar. &nbsp;You enter and place your order with a vending machine. There are only three choices: regular, with egg, and with extra pork. &nbsp;You buy your ticket, squeeze your way up to the 12-seat counter, and hand it to the friendly Japanese lady who will eventually give you your bowl of delicious ramen.</p>
<p>Ramen bar protocol seems to be this: 1) don’t dawdle; people are waiting for your seat, 2) don’t talk to each other, and 3) slurp as loud as you possibly can. &nbsp;When all twelve of us at the counter were slurping strong, it sounded like “A Little Night Music” but wetter.</p>
<p>We then went to Tokyu Hands store in Shibuya based on Dalila’s recommendation. &nbsp;It’s a really cool place — seven stories of leather goods, model trains, humidifiers, candy, pens, bath accessories and much, much more. &nbsp;Matt bought a shaving mirror and I bought bath salts for the deep soaking tub in our hotel room.</p>
<p>From Shibuya, we headed to Harajuku because I’d seen an interesting street from the train as it went by Harajuku Station. &nbsp;When we got there, we felt exceptionally old. &nbsp;Teenagers crowded the pedestrian shopping street wearing fashions that made me want to wrap a coat around them — though this is true for most of Tokyo’s women. &nbsp;It’s 34 degrees! &nbsp;Wear pants and a good hat! &nbsp;Your knees look frozen! &nbsp;On the other hand, the women here are more healthy looking. &nbsp;Matt says that maybe the women in Hong Kong look like they’re missing a good cheeseburger because the women in Tokyo ate it. &nbsp;You be the judge of that comment.</p>
<p>We finished off the day in the downtown skyscrapers of Shinjuku. &nbsp;We picked up a dinner of supermarket goodies — so mostly Japanese rice crackers, mochi balls and seaweed.</p>

<p></p><p>We started our day at Wong Tai Sin, the famous Kowloon buddhist temple where there were fistfights over the New Year as worshippers fought to get to get near the deities. &nbsp;People were much calmer today, although the staff seemed very nervous about people possibly lighting each other on fire with incense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then made our way over to Flower Market Road and the Yuen Po Bird Garden, which are exactly like they sound and a very tranquil escape from the craziness of Hong Kong. &nbsp;Bird lovers congregate in the Bird Garden to display their pets and buy treats and toys for them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a hectic shopping trip through Sham Sui Po, we headed over to Fook Lam Moon for dim sum. &nbsp;We mainly went because it’s about forty feet from our hotel, but it turns out we were at one of the best Cantonese restaurants in the world. &nbsp;We suspected something was different based on 1) the food, better than any dim sum either of us have ever eaten, 2) the preternatural service, as the staff seemed to anticipate our needs before we could think of it, 3) the rigidly observed customs of dim sum that even I’m not aware of, and 4) our fellow diners. &nbsp;At another table, there was an old chinese man in a three piece suit and a MONOCLE who was served by the manager. &nbsp;Though he was eating with his wife, the minute he got up and left, he was flanked by about four guys in suits. &nbsp;Needless to say, this was a classy place so I ended up embarrassing poor Matt with my hayseed ways.</p>
<p>After a walk through Central, we ate at Pizza Hut. &nbsp;I’d been eyeing the Pizza Hut for years! The Pizza Huts here are sit down restaurants with silverware, table linens, mixed drinks and escargot! &nbsp;We had pizza and salad. &nbsp;It was pretty good.</p>
<p>Off to Tokyo tomorrow, although we will swing through Hong Kong again on our way back to the US and already have too many things planned. &nbsp;It’ll be another chance for Matt to use his new favorite Cantonese phrase: &nbsp;”Yo Mo Gau Chau AH?!”</p>

<p></p><p>Since the weather forecast called for “brilliant sunshine”, we decided to take advantage of our early starts by beating the masses to the tram to Victoria Peak. &nbsp;As luck would have it, it was completely fogged in when we got there at 9 a.m. &nbsp;We killed time by reading Chinese newspapers and wandering the two shopping centers. &nbsp;Lunch today was at a McDonald’s because, really, you have to try a McDonald’s in every country - the menu is always different and Hong Kong didn’t disappoint.</p>
<p>At about noon, it had cleared up enough that we started out on the loop trail around the peak. &nbsp;You couldn’t see beyond Hong Kong Island, but at least we got a view of the skyscrapers.</p>
<p>Following that we headed to Sham Sui Po, a market area where the locals tend to shop. &nbsp;We finished up the day with a view of one of the world’s famous skylines, on display in a laser light show called the Symphony of Lights.</p>
<p>Also, we found frozen coke! It was frozen-y. It’s a type of coke exclusive to Hong Kong. It comes out of the vending machine as a liquid, but popping open the cap and upending it will make it freeze.</p>

<p></p><p>Hello from a much more awake blogger! I realize now that I didn’t actually say what we did yesterday. &nbsp;It was nothing much - just walked from Jordan to the habour, over to Star Ferry, took the ferry into Central Hong Kong, took the mid-levels escalator, ate at a Vietnamese restaurant for lunch, walked the Hollywood Road antiques market, the Ladies Market, and the Temple Market, ate at a Japanese Restaurant for dinner and then crashed.</p>
<p>Two things going on in the background: 1) Matt was starting to get antsy that we had been in Hong Kong for two days and had not eaten any Cantonese food in the city famous for it (we had Thai for lunch) and 2) we didn’t like our original hotel.</p>
<p>Today, we solved both those problems. &nbsp;We traded in the disappointing Eaton Hotel for the funky and comfortable (and cheaper) Luxe Manor, about five blocks south, still in the heart of the action in Kowloon. &nbsp;We also ate at a Cantonese restaurant in Causeway Bay. &nbsp;Matt’s review: &nbsp;”Typical Cantonese restaurant - dirty floors, dirty bathrooms, excellent food, underneath a highway overpass.”</p>
<p>Matt started his day much earlier that I did. &nbsp;While I relaxed and watched Gordon Ramsay shows, Matt explored the Tsim Sha Tsui area, especially looking for bakeries and supermarkets. &nbsp;Eventually, he came back for me. &nbsp;After our Thai lunch in a mall food court, we headed to Central intending to take the tram up to Victoria peak. &nbsp;We then saw that it was a 2 hour wait and said, “PLEASE.” &nbsp;We’ll try another day. &nbsp;We did see some excellent crazy Hong Kong street protestors, though.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon in Hong Kong park, a beautiful park with lakes and aviaries and conservatories, with skyscrapers looming over it. &nbsp;We visited the Hong Kong Museum of Teaware (funner than it sounds) and had tea in the adjacent tea house. &nbsp;We’re probably going to be snobs about tea and how it’s made from now on - beware.</p>
<p>After that, we took the ridiculously cheap and ridonkulously fun historic tram/trolley that runs east/west on Hong Kong island. &nbsp;When the tram entered a fun looking area, we hopped off and were in Times Square in Causeway Bay. &nbsp;We strolled the malls and markets, finally got Matt his Cantonese food and made our way back to the hotel. &nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>Hello from Hong Kong. &nbsp;Please forgive any inappropriate language or content as we are loopy from the 13 hour time change. &nbsp;Our bodies are begging us to sleep, but we are slapping that urge in the face and stepping on its neck.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is uncharacteristically cool (at least to me) at around 60 degrees. &nbsp;I keep expecting it to be 94 degrees and humid, but it is cool and pleasant. &nbsp;It really puts a different spin on the city.</p>
<p>Since the new year has not officially begun (that happens tomorrow), about 1/3 of the stores here are still closed for the holiday. &nbsp;That hasn’t stopped certain areas of the city from being crazy crowded. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Capping off Phase 1 in Budapest<br>

<p></p><p>Matt quotes an unknown wise man who says “Budapest punches above its weight.” &nbsp;Boy, does it ever. &nbsp;For a small city in a small country, it certainly feels full of potential, energy and elegance. &nbsp;We are very impressed.</p>
<p>We started our day at the Terror Haza, or House of Terror, where the Nazis and then the Communists, tortured and terrorized the Hungarian populace into submission. &nbsp;It’s a very well done, thought out museum, housed in the building where these party headquarters, imprisonments and executions took place.</p>
<p>We then skipped over to check out the Budapest Central Market where we looked for a fuzzy hat with earflaps for Matt but didn’t want to spend $150 USD on it. &nbsp;(It was a nice hat, though. &nbsp;Ahh! &nbsp;Non-buyers remorse!)</p>
<p>From the market, we went over the bridge and up Castle Hill in Buda to look at the Royal Palace and the view of Pest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we had a little time left over, we went back to the Turkish Baths for about two hours.</p>
<p>Finally, we capped off our European Vacation with a nice dinner with Hungarian specialties, piano music and dancing in our hotel room.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, off to what we hear is The Greatest City in the World!</p>

<p></p><p>Today, we ventured out to the busier commercial side of town in Pest (our hotel is in Buda). &nbsp;We took the metro for the first time and though clean and reliable, it was like taking one of the vintage trains that New York City Transit trots out around the holidays.</p>
<p>We walked along Pest’s main boulevard, Andrassy Ut, to its main shopping drag, Vaci Ucta, and saw grand boulevards with elegant stone buildings - much like Paris. &nbsp;We ate a gourmet lunch in our hotel for about $4 USD per entree. &nbsp;Budapest is about as jaw droppingly cheap as Geneva was jaw droppingly expensive.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we lolled about in the Turkish Baths behind our hotel, the Kiraly Baths. &nbsp;They were built by the Turks about 300 years ago when Budapest was part of the Ottoman Empire and it basically looks the same today. &nbsp;There were two hot pools, two cool pools, two saunas and a dome with circular windows to the open sky. &nbsp;The water is supposed to have healing qualities. &nbsp;We noticed a slight sulfuric smell and a different texture to the water. &nbsp;We spent two relaxing hours in there doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>We don’t have any photos from the baths, but you don’t want to see photos of half-naked, overweight, old, hairy Hungarian dudes. &nbsp;And if you wanted to see half-naked photos of us, you just need to ask nicely.</p>

<p></p><p>We spent our last day in Rome doing our favorite things - eating and wandering. &nbsp;Our first stop was the Caracalla Baths, or Terme di Caracalla, a palatial set of baths built by the Caracalla, son of Emperor Septimus Severus. &nbsp;The ruins do a good job of conveying the enormous scale of only one of the many Roman baths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following that, we meandered by the Circus Maximus (we saw no chariots harmed) and into Rome’s Trastevere neighborhood for lunch. &nbsp;This included two of Rome’s signature pastas, Amatriciana (tomato and beef cheek) and Cacio e Pepe (cheese and pepper), a grilled sea bass and the best Tiramisu we’ve ever tried.</p>
<p>We then strolled through the Jewish Ghetto to the Piazza Navona and the Spanish Steps before we bid Rome a good-bye.</p>

<p></p><p>We almost didn’t do it. &nbsp;Getting to Pompeii from Rome is a 2hr train ride to Naples, a half hour layover, and then a 45 minute train ride out to the archeological site. &nbsp;We weren’t sure we were up for it, but at the last moment decided not to be pansies. &nbsp;We made the right call. &nbsp;Pompeii is one of the absolute highlights of our trip. &nbsp;It is 160 acres of an incredibly well-preserved Ancient Roman town. &nbsp;You are free to explore all the streets and go into the buildings, except the few the archeologists are actively working on.</p>

<p></p><p>Today we hit the Appian Way and the Catacombs, then came back into the heart of the city and spent the afternoon at the Museo Nazionale Romano Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. &nbsp;The Catacombs were fun, but we wished we were given more free reign to explore, rather than being stuck in with a tour group. &nbsp;The rest of the Appian Way leaves a lot to be desired, too. &nbsp;The history is there, but no one has really figured out a way to display it or to make it an experience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Museo Nazionale was fantastic. &nbsp;They feature the “interior decoration” from the upper crust of ancient Roman society. &nbsp;Lots of marble statues and frescos. &nbsp;They’ve uncovered and reconstructed the sun room from Livia Drusila’s villa and have a number of fantastic frescos from the villa of Marcus Agrippa. &nbsp;It’s pretty crazy to look at a fresco and think “Marcus Agrippa looked at this fresco.”</p>

<p></p><p>Today, we took a trip to Vatican City to see St. Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Museum - home of the Sistine Chapel, Rafael’s Rooms and so much priceless art that they don’t seem to know how to display it all. &nbsp;It could give the Metropolitan in New York a run for its money in terms of taking several days to see. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We decided to hit the highlights of both St. Peter’s and the Vatican and were awed by both, including Bernini’s altar, statues and colonnade, Michaelangelo’s Pieta and Sistine Chapel and Boticelli and Raphael’s works. &nbsp;It’s heartening that these touted masterpieces really are as stunning in person as you hear they are. &nbsp;One of the dangers of Vatican City (and Rome in general) is that if you linger too long, you get trapped in a tour group and the only way out is with elbows.</p>

<p></p><p>Yesterday was the appetizer. &nbsp;Today we went in and hit Ancient Rome hard. &nbsp;We started at the Forum, continued at the Palatine Hill and ended at the Colosseum. &nbsp;It’s amazing after studying Latin from Roman storybooks, watching “Gladiator”, “Rome” and “Engineering Marvels” and “Engineering Disasters” on History Channel, that we were standing where it all happened.</p>

<p></p><p>We had a quiet New Year’s Day in Geneva by taking a walk nearby … in France! &nbsp;Honestly, we took the Number 8 bus to the end of the line and walked about 100 feet and we were in France. &nbsp;It happened without warning - like a tornado or gaining weight.</p>
<p>We took another telepherique (cable car) — which is fast becoming one of our favorite modes of transportation — to the top of Mont Saleve. &nbsp;There are hikes around the peak which afford views of Geneva and Mont Blanc. &nbsp; Simply stunning.</p>
<p>Today we woke up at 3:45 a.m. and caught our 6:25 a.m. flight to Roma. &nbsp;Our first day we took it slow by walking to the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Trajan’s Column and Markets, Monument of Vittorio Emmanuel, Pantheon, Piazza Navona and Spanish Steps. &nbsp;The cobblestoned streets of Rome make that walk feel about twice as long in your feet.</p>
<p>We had a surprisingly delicious pasta meal in a restaurant where we tried our hardest to distance ourselves from the Americans sitting near us - I suspect they were New Yorkers, but the Long Island kind.</p>

<p></p><p>Today we took a rest day. &nbsp;Which means we spent the morning doing laundry. &nbsp;In the afternoon we hopped on the tram (visitors to Geneva get free access to the city’s public transportation) out to the United Nations buildings.</p>

<h2>Ancient Gloomy Castles are our Thing<br>

<p></p><p>Today, we donned our rain gear and braved the intermittent rain to visit the Chateau de Chillon near Montreaux, Switzerland. &nbsp;We have fond memories of the castle (Hamlet’s Castle) we visited on a dark, stormy and windswept day in Elsingor, Denmark so this seemed fitting.</p>
<p>Chateau de Chillon is about 1&nbsp;1/2 hours by train from Geneva. &nbsp;The train ride is very pretty as it skirts Lake Geneva. &nbsp;We decided to get off in Montreaux, which seems to be a resort town, but everything was closed for the winter and there were very few people because it was raining. &nbsp;The 4&nbsp;km walk along Lake Geneva from Montreaux to Chateau de Chillon was odd - filled with very happy topiaries, palm trees and very sad inflatable Christmas ornaments. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chateau itself dates from the 12th century and served as a defense point and tolling gate between North and South Europe past the shores of Lake Geneva. &nbsp;It was the residence of the Dukes of Savoy and the Bernese. &nbsp;Apparently, a lot of people were tortured there, kept captive in the subterranean prison and burnt at the stake. &nbsp;It’s easy to imagine. &nbsp;The Chateau retains its open air windows, rough-hewn stone floors, stone vaults and rusting doors. &nbsp;Very dramatic and even romantic, especially with the storm and wind whipping around and the waves of Lake Geneva crashing on its banks.</p>
<p>One side note: &nbsp;we had noticed that the most common tourist, by far, are Chinese tourists. &nbsp;They seem to be this decade’s Japanese tourist. &nbsp;We’ve started taking bets on how many we will see.</p>

<p></p><p>Today we drove into the Bernese Oberland, stopping for a delicious lunch in the town of Spiez. &nbsp;From our lunch table we had spectacular views of a castle, the Thunersee and the Niederhorn.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lwzlaoa2Ql1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<div><em>The Spiez Schloss, the Thunersee, and the Niederhorn.</em></div>
<p>After lunch we drove on down the lake to Interlaken and turned south into the Y-shaped valley that forms the heart of the Jungfrau district. &nbsp;Both sides of the valley are lined with spectacular jagged peaks; on the left-hand branch of the Y is the town of Grindelwald, on the right-hand branch, the town of Lauterbrunnen.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lwzkziG72g1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p><em>The cog railway in Grindelwald. &nbsp;The Wetterhorn in the background.</em></p>
<p>At the head of the Y-shaped valley lie the three tallest peaks in the district, the Eiger, the Monch, and the Jungfrau. &nbsp;The Eiger Nordwand is probably the single most iconic peak in the history of rock climbing. &nbsp;It is also notoriously difficult to see — always enshrouded in clouds. &nbsp;After checking out the gingerbread houses in the town of Grindelwald, we caught the cog railway to Kleine Scheidegg, the jumping-off point for climbs on the Eiger, and the best place for viewing the cliff face, if it is not socked in with clouds.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lwzi3t7mxe1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Willa with the Eiger behind her, taken from Kleine Scheidegg.</em></p>
<p>We waited an hour for the clouds to break. &nbsp;There were a couple of tantalizing moments.</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lwziwjo5Ss1r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p>Eventually we gave up and got back on the cog railway for our ride back down to Grindelwald. &nbsp;As the little train rolled directly under the Eiger Nordwand, the clouds disappeared and all 5900’ of the Eiger towered above us. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="./images/tumblr_lwzli9v1m71r3lvhr.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a pretty awesome experience. &nbsp;After returning to the valley floor we drove up the Lauterbrunnen branch of the valley to get a view of the Jungfrau.</p>

<p></p><p>Today we got an early start. &nbsp;And then ran into trouble with the car rental wherein I (Matt) made the reservation for the wrong days. &nbsp;But we worked it out and found a car and headed south from Geneva to Chamonix. &nbsp;Even with the delay, we managed to beat the crowds and didn’t have to wait long at all in line for the&nbsp;<span>Telepherique de l’<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiguille_du_Midi" target="_blank">Aiguille du Midi</a>. &nbsp;It’s a gondola that takes you from 3395 ft in altitude up to 12604 ft in about 20 minutes. &nbsp;Needless to say, the view from the top is spectacular. &nbsp;They’ve tunneled out the tip of the Aiguille and there is a restaurant, a cafeteria, and a gift shop in there. &nbsp;And terraces with unbelievable vistas in every direction. &nbsp;We spent 3 or 4 hours up there and then caught the gondola back to the village and walked around Chamonix. &nbsp;It’s a pretty busy place with people in ski boots and carrying skis walking up and down the main street.</span></p>

<p>We walked around the city today, skirting Lake Geneva, heading into the old town, ambling around some parks and visiting the Museum of Art and History. &nbsp; We saw the world’s longest bench and the second highest fountain in action on the Lake. &nbsp;(Word is that some engineers from the Middle East came to study the fountain and built one that shoots water just a few meters higher. &nbsp;One-ups-man-ship!)</p>

<p></p><p>Oh, Barcelona! &nbsp;We hardly knew ye - but we’ll be back to work you over some more. &nbsp;The land of narrow winding medieval lanes, excellent food and hopping energy deserves another visit. &nbsp;There was still so much we wanted to do. &nbsp;The top of that list is to spend at least one more day (and probably two) at the Monistario de Monserrat.</p>
<p>The monastery is about 30 minutes drive from Barcelona and set on top of Monserrat, a bizarre looking mountain with serrated conglomerate rock that sticks straight up from flat ground. &nbsp;We were trying to figure out how the mountain could have gotten there and our best guess is seismic event. &nbsp;Surely there are some geologists out there who can help us?</p>
<p>A cable car takes visitors from the base of the mountain about 2/3 of the way up, where there is a museum, cafe, visitor center and oh, also a monastery. &nbsp;There are fantastic views from the cable car. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to go to the top, you can hike or take the funicular. &nbsp;Since we were low on time, we took that to the top and barely had time to eat our last Iberico sandwiches before we begrudgingly made our way down. &nbsp; We could see hikes out to cliffs and look outs; as well as stairs cut right into the mountain. &nbsp;All we can do is promise to return.</p>

<p></p><p>Feliz Navidad and Bon Nadal! &nbsp;We started out our Christmas Day by car (through a surprising amount of Christmas Day traffic) to the eastern coast of Spain, north of Barcelona. &nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: &nbsp;If you’re renting a car outside of the U.S., you have to bring your credit card, drivers license AND your passport. &nbsp;Failure to do so will cause a desperate race from the airport to your hotel room in the middle of Barcelona and will involve two trains, two metro rides and the vaulting of a set of stairs.</p>
<p>We started out the drive a little later than we would have liked, through no fault of our own. &nbsp;We drove down Spain’s highways and toll-roads. &nbsp;By the way, 9,50 euro for about 100 miles of highway would be unheard of in the U.S. &nbsp;We reached Cadaques, the easternmost point of mainland Spain, saw a lighthouse, some interesting rock and got blown about. &nbsp;We also saw a beautiful sunset over the mountains and the Mediterranean and an amazing coastal drive along the waterfront of Cadaques.</p>
<p>We finished with a nice dinner back in Barcelona along La Rambla. &nbsp;Hope you had a good holiday, too!</p>

<p></p><p>We started our day with another nice morning walk down to the shoreline, followed with a trip to the top floor restaurant in the department store El Corte Ingles. &nbsp;We had staked out that restaurant early on for the view and the paella.</p>
<p>Following another midday nap (it’s Spain!), we took the Funicular to the top of Montjuic, the mountain that overlooks the shore and Barcelona. &nbsp;While there, we saw the Olympic facilities, which are built on a grand scale and Calatrava’s Needle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The view from Montjuic Castle was breathtaking. &nbsp;We vowed to stay and watch the sunset and see the lights twinkle on across Barcelona, but our butts got cold on the stone benches. &nbsp;Onward!</p>

<p></p><p>We started the morning at the&nbsp;Museu d’HistÃ²ria de Barcelona (MUHBA) where we saw excavations of the Roman ruins underlying the Barri Gotic. &nbsp;Pretty cool — you can still see the remains of the factories where they made salted cod, where they made wine, and stained and dyed clothing. &nbsp;We then strolled over to the Boqueria where we purchased an all-Boqueria lunch including salad with fresh Mediterranean tomatoes and jamon iberico. &nbsp;In the afternoon we took the bus number 24 from&nbsp;PlaÃ§a de Catalunya to&nbsp;Park GÃ¼ell. &nbsp;The park is another Guadi design, full of weird, organic-looking designs from the crazy master. &nbsp;We ended the day with dinner at a tapas bar in El Born.</p>

<p></p><p>We started our day with a leisurely stroll through the Eixample, the “addition”. &nbsp;It’s a grid system of streets that was constructed when Barcelona exploded past its traditional Roman walls. &nbsp;It’s also where the Moderniste architectural movement took hold. &nbsp;We took a walking tour of several notable examples of Moderniste architecture, finishing up at Gaudi’s most famous work, the Sagrada Familia. &nbsp;We are in agreement that he was 1) clearly a genius and 2) clearly disturbed.</p>
<p>Following a lunch of tapas (with iberico ham!) and paella (too salty, will try again), we decided to do as the Romans (Catalunyans) do and take an afternoon nap. &nbsp;Since the city seems to slow between 3 and 5 for naptime, we strove to do the same. &nbsp;It is the way to LIVE. &nbsp;We woke up, stretched, scratched and headed back out, completely refreshed.</p>
<p>The Gothic Quarter is something else at night, with the medieval buildings, squares and back alleys lit up by street lanterns and flood lights. &nbsp;When you get away from the crowds, you feel like you could have gone back in time. &nbsp;If you get lonely, a few steps will take you back to the teeming shopping and eating streets. &nbsp;We had Japanese for dinner because Matt correctly pointed out that their seafood is killer fresh and he was right - the tuna, salmon and eel that we had was insane. &nbsp;We followed it up with freshly made churros dipped in dark, rich hot chocolate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Great weather again, sunny and in the 60’s - what a great town!</p>

<p></p><p>We woke up today to mild weather and sunny skies in Barcelona and immediately went on one of our favorite hobbies of all time - shopping in markets in foreign countries. &nbsp;Our first stop was La Boqueria, the city’s huge open air market that is behind our hotel. &nbsp;We gawked at fruits, candies, meats and fishes that we’d never seen before and eventually purchased (Matt got candies, Willa’s tripe stand was closed). &nbsp;Our next stop was the supermarket to stock up on necessities like cereal, water, juice and a knife to slice our wonderful foodstuffs.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went to La Paradeta, a restaurant in the Barri Gothic (Gothic Quarter), where you can select your seafood while it is on ice and then the kitchen prepares it for you. &nbsp;It was delicious - thanks for the recommendation Phil!</p>
<p>Off we went wandering again, through the Gothic Quarter, down to Barceloneta on the mediterranean coast and back again. &nbsp;A beautiful city on a beautiful day. &nbsp;Can’t wait to see more tomorrow.</p>

<p></p><p>On our last day in Amsterdam, we took an epic walk through the Jordaan and the Canal Belt to Vondelpark, while the weather was good. &nbsp;Finally, sun in Amsterdam! &nbsp; The city is as beautiful and charming as we remembered.</p>
<p>We also partook of a mini-version of the Ristaffel (or rice table). &nbsp;It was created by the Dutch to sample many of the dishes of Indonesia in one sitting. &nbsp;We went to Kantjil and de Tigre, which had a “Ristaffel Preview”, an abbreviated version of the meal. &nbsp;It was a lot of food so we are in awe of people who tackle the real thing at dinner time. &nbsp;Also, DELICIOUS.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, we hopped our flight to Barcelona. &nbsp;Since we are visiting what is possibly the best European city for food, you would only expect that we had whoppers and fries at Burger King for dinner. &nbsp;So we did. &nbsp;Here’s to the Whopper. &nbsp;USA! &nbsp;USA!</p>

<h2>Utrecht, Itrecht, We All ... trecht<br>

<p></p><p>Today, we headed south on the train to Utrecht, and it looks less than 30 minutes! &nbsp;You really can get anywhere in Holland on the train in no time at all. &nbsp;Utrecht is an old University town and sure enough, most of the other passengers on the train were younger than us - how depressing.</p>
<p>We walked around Utrecht, which is also charming. &nbsp;One noticeable difference is that they have a lower terrace that fronts onto their canals and the streets and buildings are one level above. &nbsp;Most museums are closed on Mondays, so we ended up at the University Museum, the only one open. &nbsp;Matt was skeptical that the museum would be worth the 7 euro entrance fee per person, but we ended up spending most of the afternoon there. &nbsp;They had interactive exhibits, cabinets of curiosities, medical oddities - it was a small, but oddly entertaining museum.</p>
<p>Good weather in Utrecht! &nbsp;More rain in Amsterdam.</p>

<h2>A Relaxing Day in Amsterdam<br>

<p></p><p>The rain, wind and cold picked up again today in Amsterdam, which cut our wandering ways short. &nbsp;We did run into another impromptu concert in Dam Square, this time with wind instruments and some excellent tuba action.</p>
<p>We walked through the Christmas market in Rembrandtplein and then continued past the Botanical Garden and towards the Tropenmuseum or Tropical Museum. &nbsp;The museum’s aim was originally to display the way of life of people in the Dutch colonies and not in a sensitive way. &nbsp;Nowadays, the Dutch have done an about face and are critical of the way that the Dutch East India Company and supporting military forces acted in Indonesia, Suriname, etc. &nbsp;Displays are about the culture and art from those countries and the history of Dutch interaction.</p>
<p>On the way back, we got rained on so we slunk back to our hotel room to have mint tea (made from real fresh mint) and watched TV. &nbsp;Amsterdam’s weather may be doing us a favor by forcing us to rest.</p>
<p>To Utrecht tomorrow!</p>

<h2>Haarlem<br>

<p></p><p>Today, we visited the town of Haarlem and realized that Haarlem is closer to Amsterdam than Harlem is to what was New Amsterdam in New York. &nbsp; The train ride took about 16 minutes. &nbsp;I was expecting a mini-Amsterdam, but Haarlem has its own vibe. &nbsp;The streets are on a smaller scale, the homes and businesses a little more cozy and there are more gardens and flowers. &nbsp;There was a market with produce (like mushrooms!), cheese, bread, fish, meats and gifts. &nbsp;We ran into another Christmas concert, but it was a spirited choir instead of a full on televised production like in Dam Square. &nbsp;On the whole, the city was charming.</p>
<p>The highlights of our visit were mostly food related again, quiche, hot chocolate, mint tea, crusty breads, gourmet garlic sausage, but we also visited the de Adriaan windmill museum where we got a personal tour of the working windmill. &nbsp;The de Adriaan was a working windmill from 1778-1932 when it burned to the ground. &nbsp;55 volunteer “windmill enthusiasts” have rebuilt the windmill in 2002 and now the windmill serves as a museum about how windmills work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No rain for our trip to Haarlem, but rain back in Amsterdam. &nbsp;We’ll try again tomorrow with Amsterdam. &nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>Today we set out on a wander - something we are quickly turning into an Olympic sport. &nbsp;We walked past a place called Pancakes! Amsterdam and Matt decided he’d like to test out if that exclamation point was warranted. &nbsp;What came was a slightly salty pancake filled with very tart apples and suikerstroop (sugar syrup). &nbsp;We yearned for maple but realized that maple syrup may be a blessing only for North Americans.</p>
<p>It rained on and off all day in a light drizzle so our waterproof coats really came in handy. &nbsp;We walked the Albert Cuypstraat and bought stuffed peppedew peppers, stuffed dates, cheese and bread for a late lunch. &nbsp; After a wander through the De Pijp and Canal Belt neighborhoods, we set out for a stroll through the Red Light District. &nbsp;On the way, we had Indonesian food for dinner and waved to the nice ladies in the windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On our way back to the hotel, we ran into a live concert on Dam Square. &nbsp;There were a lot of people there to listen to what we can only surmise are famous Dutch performers, but beneath the notice of Americans, what with our superior entertainers, such as Carrot Top and any Kardashian.</p>

<p></p><p>We bid a fond farewell and see you again soon to London today and took off for Amsterdam. &nbsp;Though it is cold, rainy, windy and dark - no one seems to have realized that they shouldn’t be out on the streets and winding roads are packed! &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are taking it easy today. &nbsp;As my Mattie says, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. &nbsp;Also, we now have easy access to Internet so more posts and more photos.</p>
<p>In that vein, here are a few photos from the last two days:</p>

<p></p><p>After a whirlwind tour of the British Museum, a visit to the Victoria and Albert Museum wasn’t long enough, and a race through the Natural History museum, we arrived in the West End for dinner at Wagamama’s (the London institution). &nbsp;We then took a quick tour of Soho and Covent Garden. &nbsp;And then took our front row seats to a West End performance of Les Miserables. &nbsp;It was glorious. &nbsp;Matt says he’ll never go to the theatre again unless we sit in the front row.</p><p></p>

<p></p><p>Our day started with a concierge telling us not to go the East End because a guest had&nbsp;come back with seventeen stitches. We thanked him and hopped the tube to Brick Lane. &nbsp;The only thing we seemed to be in danger of was getting bumped by hipsters and&nbsp;getting heartburn from curries. We wandered the very crowded and very unique craft&nbsp;and food stalls of Petticoat Lane market, Brick Lane market and Old Spitalfields market.</p>
<p>Lunch on Brick Lane was tasty Bengali food. &nbsp;After that we headed over to the Science Museum and walked through a mall that had&nbsp;a Santa’s Grotto. We peered in but were disappointed that the only thing in there was Santa sitting by himself.</p>
